Inferno!

Start in the Nether
No Nether Fortresses
Custom Ruins
Make sure Blood / Honey from Biomes doesn't make stone? If not, use Pyrotheum?
Make sure you aren't completely boxed in by mobs - two exits that are 64 blocks apart
Starting crypt connected by lit tunnel

Natura-
Netherack furnace
Nether Hopper
4 types of trees
Glowshrooms and berries?  Food?

Goals:
Make It Back To Overworld


Questions:
Can we disable stone / obsidian from other Nether liquids

Current Issues:
Honey and Blood make Obsidian
Fusewood / Darkwood / Ghostwood are too rare
Is Smoldering grass a "dirt" block?
Not sure how to make starting structure
Control biome size, make more normal "hell"
Lava blocks aren't flowing after generation
Clean way to disable Nether Fortresses
Balance initial tools / items
Could we disable normal portals and make some other form of "exit" portal?

ToDo List:
- Find issue with Biomes O Plenty Hell generation
- Find issue with Natura plants / trees being over-written by "ground" in Nether
- Generate Initial starting structure
- Implement New Harvest Levels for blocks
- Blend in BoP and Natura Nether crops with Agricraft

[15:24] <Ivorius> Sure
[15:24] <Ivorius> Well, either you decide for a block and add a block replace transformer, with each possibility as an output
[15:25] <Ivorius> Or you use a spawn command block with much the same capabilities
[15:25] <Ivorius> Running /setblock ~ ~ ~ block on each entry
[15:26] <Ivorius> Oh yeah, if you have the log level set to the highest possible, RC will also log "Spawning static structure at [...]"
[15:26] <Ivorius> Where you set that depends on the launcher
[15:26] <Ivorius> But that helps sometimes
[15:30] <Ivorius> Oh dang, even the startGraveyard thing is pretty huge
[15:30] <Ivorius> 120 x 120? That's like 64 chunks force-generated x)
[15:33] <Ivorius> I'm currently also working on partial generation, which would get rid of the problem of huge structures
[15:34] <Ivorius> But there's a bunch of things left to fix and adress
[15:38] <Ivorius> Is your structure some kind of arena thing?
